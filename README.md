# Thermal-and-Visual-Comfort-for-Naturally-Ventilated-Educational-Building-# Thermal and Visual Comfort (TVC) Prediction Project

## What the project does
This project aims to develop machine learning models to accurately predict Thermal and Visual Comfort (TVC) using field survey data from a naturally ventilated educational building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

## Why the project is useful
TVC significantly impacts the health and productivity of occupants and indoor environmental quality in educational buildings. By accurately predicting TVC, this project can help improve comfort levels and building performance.

## Getting started
To get started with the project:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file to explore the machine learning models and data analysis
